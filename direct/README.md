## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Your Apps Script
1. Open your Apps Script project
2. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **New Deployment**
3. Choose **Web App** as the type
4. Set **Execute as**: Me
5. Set **Who has access**: Anyone
6. Click **Deploy** and copy the Web App URL

### Step 2: Configure Frontend
1. Open `config.js` in your repository
2. Replace `YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID` with your actual deployment ID from the URL:
   ```javascript
   // Change this line:
   API_URL: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec',
   
   // To something like:
   API_URL: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw1234567890abcdef/exec',
   ```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Scroll to **Pages** section
3. Select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
5. Click **Save**

Your frontend will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

## üîß Configuration Options

### API Configuration
In `config.js`, you can customize:

```javascript
const THRIVOY_CONFIG = {
    API_URL: 'YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_URL',
    DEBUG: true,                    // Enable console logging
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT: 30000,         // 30 second timeout
    MAX_RETRIES: 3,                 // Retry failed requests
    
    FEATURES: {
        AI_CONTENT_GENERATION: true,
        SOCIAL_SHARING: true,
        PAYMENT_INTEGRATION: true,
        ANALYTICS_TRACKING: true
    }
};
```

### CORS Solution
The frontend uses JSONP (JSON with Padding) to avoid CORS issues:
- Primary method: JSONP requests to Apps Script
- Fallback: Standard POST requests with CORS headers
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

## üìã Backend Requirements

Ensure your Apps Script has these functions:
- `onboardNewBusiness_()` - Handle new signups
- `getDashboardData()` - Return dashboard info
- `getThankYouData()` - Return success page data
- `generateSmartTaglineForBusiness()` - AI content generation
- `createPaymentInvoice()` - Payment processing

## üé® Customization

### Colors and Branding
Edit CSS variables in any HTML file:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #1166EE;      /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #FF8800;    /* Accent color */
    --accent-color: #28a745;       /* Success color */
}
```

### Content Updates
- **Landing page**: Edit `index.html`
- **Form fields**: Modify `onboard.html`
- **Dashboard layout**: Update `dashboard.html`
- **Success messaging**: Change `thank-you.html`

## üîç Testing the Setup

### 1. Test API Connection
Open browser console on any page and run:
```javascript
ThrivoyAPI.healthCheck().then(result => {
    console.log('API Status:', result ? 'Connected' : 'Failed');
});
```

### 2. Test Form Submission
1. Go to your GitHub Pages URL + `/onboard.html`
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Submit and check for success/error messages
4. Verify data appears in your Google Spreadsheet

### 3. Test Dashboard
Access: `your-site.com/dashboard.html?businessId=BIZ-1234567890`

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Errors
**Problem**: "Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy"
**Solution**: The frontend automatically uses JSONP to avoid CORS. Ensure your Apps Script deployment allows "Anyone" access.

### API Connection Failed
**Problem**: API health check fails
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Apps Script deployment URL is correct in `config.js`
2. Check Apps Script is deployed as "Web App" not "API Executable"
3. Ensure "Execute as: Me" and "Who has access: Anyone"

### Form Submission Errors
**Problem**: Form submits but no data received
**Solutions**:
1. Check Apps Script logs for errors
2. Verify `onboardNewBusiness_()` function exists and is correct
3. Test API endpoint directly: `your-script-url?action=test`

### Website Generation Fails
**Problem**: Website created but not accessible
**Solutions**:
1. Verify GitHub token has repo write permissions
2. Check GitHub Pages is enabled and deployed
3. Ensure GitHub repository is public or GitHub Pro account

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

The frontend automatically logs:
- Page visits and form interactions
- API request success/failure rates
- User journey through signup flow
- Error occurrences with context

Access logs in your master spreadsheet "Logs" tab.

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All form data is validated before submission
- Phone numbers are formatted and validated
- Email addresses are verified with regex
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### API Security
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (15 requests/minute)
- Request timeouts prevent hanging connections
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Add CNAME file to repository root:
   ```
   yourdomain.com
   ```
2. Configure DNS A records to point to GitHub Pages IPs
3. Update `config.js` with your custom domain

### Email Integration
Configure in Apps Script properties:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: For system alerts
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL`: Customer support address
- `DEFAULT_SENDER`: Email sender name

### Payment Gateway
Currently supports UPI payments. Configure:
- `UPI_ID`: Your business UPI ID
- Payment webhook URLs for verification

## üìû Support

### Self-Help
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify all configuration steps completed
3. Test individual components separately
